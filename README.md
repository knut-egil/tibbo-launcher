# Tibbo Launcher
A proof-of-concept game launcher for Tibbo! 

## Features
- Display game changelog
- Display latest game version
- Automatically check for & install game updates
- A working progressbar?! Somewhat at least..!

## Todo
- Automatically check for & update the launcher itself (w/ signature checking for "security"?)

This was a nice, quick little project to refresh my very rust C# knowledge and skills, I also found out that I actually understand how to design WPF stuff!
